## Introduction

This repository hosts the code for a modern and elegant cafe website. As a frontend developer, I've put my skills to work to create an engaging and visually appealing online presence for a fictional cafe. This project demonstrates my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as my ability to design responsive and user-friendly web interfaces.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

- **Navigation**: The website features a dynamic navigation bar that smoothly transitions from a hamburger menu on smaller screens to a full navigation menu on larger screens.

- **Sections**: The website is divided into distinct sections such as "Home," "About," "Subscribe," and "Contact," allowing users to easily find the information they're looking for.

- **Media Integration**: Engaging videos are seamlessly integrated to showcase the cafe's offerings, creating an immersive experience for users.

- **Mailing List Subscription**: Users can subscribe to the cafe's mailing list through a subscription form, demonstrating form validation using JavaScript.

- **Contact Information and Map**: The "Contact" section provides the cafe's address, phone number, and email address. Additionally, an embedded Google Map showcases the cafe's location.

- **Opening Hours**: Users can view the cafe's opening hours, helping them plan their visit accordingly.
